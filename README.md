# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor a work day scheduler so that users can view their daily schedule during business hours from 9am to 5pm. Once on the page, users can see the day, month and date at the top. Below, the current hour shows up as red, the future hours show up as green and past hours show up as gray. Users are able to save information under each hour so they can go back to the page and see what's happening next in their day.

## Usage

Users can follow the link to the deployed webpage to access the work day scheduler. Click in the text area to fill in your daily schedule next to the appropriate hour and click the blue "save" button on the right.
